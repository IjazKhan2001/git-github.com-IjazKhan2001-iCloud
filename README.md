This website is called NEXT and it has a bunch of cool features. 
First I used the index.html for all of my descriptions plus the about us, contact us, videos, and social media part.
I used CSS for all of the colors and the hover effects on the website. 
I used the app.js for the javascript and made sure everything was working properly.
If you go to the header and navigate through the different topis the pictures will change.
I have hover effects on all the buttons so when you put a mouse on the button it will get bigger and change to a different color.
I have some pictures on the bottom that will expand when you hover over it and there is also buttons on the pictures so when you hover over the buttons they will expand and change colors.
I hope you can take a look at the website I made!
